ðŸ“˜ Algorithm vs Program
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

It is language-independent (written in plain English or pseudocode).

Focus is on logic, not syntax.

Example (Algorithm to find sum of 2 numbers):

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read two numbers A and B
Step 3: Add A and B â†’ SUM
Step 4: Print SUM
Step 5: Stop

ðŸ”¹ 2. What is a Program?

A program is the actual implementation of an algorithm in a programming language (like C++, Python, Java).

It is language-dependent.

The program can be executed by a computer.

Example (Program in C++ to find sum of 2 numbers):

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b, sum;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    sum = a + b;
    cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}

| **Definition**      | Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem   | Implementation of an algorithm in code      |
| **Form**            | Written in any lang. pseudocode or flowchart| Written in programming language (C++, Python, etc.) |
| **Execution**       | Cannot be executed directly by a computer   | Can be executed directly by a computer      |
| **Purpose**         | Focuses on logic and problem-solving steps  | Focuses on solving the problem practically  |
| **Dependency**      | Independent of any programming language     | Dependent on programming language           |
| **Examples**        | Algorithm for sorting numbers, finding max  | Bubble Sort in C++, Python code for max     |


ðŸ”¹ 4. Analogy

Algorithm = Recipe written in a cookbook.

Program = Actual cooking using ingredients in the kitchen.

âœ… Summary for Students:

First design the algorithm (logic).

Then write the program (code) to make the computer solve it.

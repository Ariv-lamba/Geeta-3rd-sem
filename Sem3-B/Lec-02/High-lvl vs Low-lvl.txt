ðŸ“˜ High-Level vs Low-Level Languages
ðŸ”¹ 1. Low-Level Language

Closest to machine (hardware).

Machine-dependent â†’ code varies from one computer architecture to another.

Faster execution but harder for humans to read/write.

Two types:

Machine Language (binary 0 and 1)

Assembly Language (uses mnemonics like MOV, ADD).

Example (Assembly Code):

MOV AX, 5
MOV BX, 10
ADD AX, BX

ðŸ”¹ 2. High-Level Language

Close to human language, easier to understand.

Machine-independent â†’ same code can run on different systems (with compiler).

Slower than low-level (needs compilation/interpretation).

Examples: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript.

Example (C++ Code):

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10;
    cout << "Sum = " << a + b;
    return 0;
}

# High-Level vs Low-Level Languages

| Feature           | Low-Level Language                         | High-Level Language                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Closeness**     | Close to hardware, machine-oriented        | Close to humans, problem-oriented      |
| **Ease of Use**   | Hard to read and write                     | Easy to read and write                 |
| **Portability**   | Not portable (machine dependent)           | Portable (works on multiple systems)   |
| **Speed**         | Very fast execution                        | Slower (needs compilation/interpret.)  |
| **Error Handling**| Hard to debug                              | Easier to debug                        |
| **Examples**      | Machine code, Assembly                     | C, C++, Java, Python                   |

ðŸ”¹ 4. Analogy

Low-Level Language â†’ Like talking to a computer in its own native language (binary/assembly).

High-Level Language â†’ Like talking to a computer using English-like instructions (C++, Python).

âœ… Summary for Students:

Low-level = fast, hardware-level, but hard to write.

High-level = easy to write, portable, but needs a compiler/interpreter.

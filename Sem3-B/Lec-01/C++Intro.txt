1. What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs.
It is an extension of C language, with added features like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), better memory management, and rich libraries.
C++ is known as a middle-level language because it supports both low-level features (like pointers, memory management) and high-level features (like classes, objects, and STL).

It is widely used in:

System programming (OS, device drivers)
Game development
Competitive programming
Real-time simulations and performance-critical applications
The process of running a C++ program involves several steps:

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Writing the Code (Source Code)
You write code in a .cpp file using an editor (VS Code, Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, etc.).
Example:

/*
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
*/

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Compilation
The compiler (e.g., g++) translates the human-readable source code (.cpp) into object code (.o or .obj) which is machine-readable (binary instructions).
At this stage, syntax errors (like missing ;) are detected.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Linking

The linker combines your object code with required libraries (like <iostream> for cout, <math> for sqrt).
It generates a single executable file (e.g., a.exe on Windows, a.out on Linux).
Errors here are linker errors (e.g., if a function is declared but not defined).

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Execution

The executable file is loaded into memory by the Operating System.
The CPU executes the instructions line by line.
Output is shown to the user (e.g., on terminal/console).
